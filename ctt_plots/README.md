# Flow induced compositional tensor trains

The core idea is to parametrize the right-hand side of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using a tensor train (TT) decomposition, such that the discretization of the ODE via standard numerical methods, such as the Explicit Euler scheme, implicitly induces a compositional TT structure.
